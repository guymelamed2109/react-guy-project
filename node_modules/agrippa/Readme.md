Agrippa is a CLI that helps frontend developers generate new components without the boilerplate: in a single command, it can create all the folders and files you need in a full component, with starting code tailored to your stack.

## Migrating from v1

Agrippa 2.0 introduces some API changes - the config is now a JS file and is structured a bit differently, and some options have been changed - but at large the functionality and usage is the same as v1.

To get a feel for the new version and see what's new, we recommend taking the new [Getting Started](https://www.agrippa.dev/getting-started/) tutorial, or the concise [Set up Agrippa in a project](https://www.agrippa.dev/guides/setup-agrippa-in-a-project/) guide.

Lastly, our new docs site, [agrippa.dev](https://www.agrippa.dev), contains reference pages regarding the options and config in v2, which you may find useful.
